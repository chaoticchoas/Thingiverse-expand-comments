Simple script to expand comments on Thingiverse.com. It should work for both Firefox or Chrome. May take a while on pages with huge ammounts of comments.

You need to install either [Tempermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) to use this script.

I made this script about 2 years ago when Thingiverse made changes to their website to not only allow you to expand or collapse comments but they also set the default to alway collapse the replys. This made it difficult to find info that is in the comments as you could no longer CTRL+F to find info like print setting for certain printer or helpful comments especially in popular print.
